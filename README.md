# QuantSeq prep

## Analysis

## Description

We used `idemux` - an inline barcode demultiplexing tool - to demultiplex paired-end FASTQ files from QuantSeq-Pool. This process allows us to separate individual samples based on their unique barcodes within a pooled sequencing run, preparing the data for downstream analysis.
